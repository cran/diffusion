\usage{
seqdiffusion(x, cleanlead = c(TRUE, FALSE), prew = NULL, l = 2,
  cumulative = c(TRUE, FALSE), pvalreps = 0, eliminate = c(FALSE, TRUE),
  sig = 0.05, verbose = c(FALSE, TRUE), type = c("bass", "gompertz",
  "gsgompertz"), optim = c("nm", "hj"), maxiter = Inf, opttol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix containing in each column the adoption per period for generation k}

\item{cleanlead}{removes leading zeros for fitting purposes (default == T)}

\item{prew}{the \code{w} of the previous generation. This is used for
sequential fitting.}

\item{l}{the l-norm (1 is absolute errors, 2 is squared errors)}

\item{cumulative}{If TRUE optimisation is done on cumulative adoption.}

\item{pvalreps}{bootstrap repetitions to estimate (marginal) p-values}

\item{eliminate}{if TRUE eliminates insignificant parameters from the
estimation. Forces \code{pvalreps = 1000} if left to 0.}

\item{sig}{significance level used to eliminate parameters}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE console output is provided during estimation (default
== F)}

\item{type}{of diffusion curve to use. This can be "bass", "gompertz" and
"gsgompertz"}

\item{optim}{optimization method to use. This can be "nm" for Nelder-Meade or
"hj" for Hooke-Jeeves. #' @param maxiter number of iterations the optimser
takes (default == \code{10000} for "nm" and \code{Inf} for "hj")}

\item{opttol}{Tolerance for convergence (default == 1.e-06)}

\item{w}{vector of curve parameters (see note). If provided no estimation
is done.}

\value{
Returns an object of class \code{seqdiffusion}, which contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{type} diffusion model type used
\item \code{diffusion} returns model specification for each generation (see
\code{\link{diffusion}} for details)
\item \code{call} calls function fitted
\item \code{w} named matrix of fitted parameters for each generation
\item \code{x} matrix of actuals
\item \code{mse} insample Mean Squared Error for each generation
\item \code{pval} all p-values for \code{w} at each generation
}
}
\description{
This function fits diffusion curves of the type \code{"bass"}, 
\code{"gompertz"} or \code{gsgompertz} across generations. Parameters are 
estimated for each generation individually by minimising the Mean Squared 
Error with the subplex algorithm from the nloptr package. Optionally p-values
of the coefficients can be determined via bootstraping. Furthermore, the
bootstrapping allows to remove insignificant parameters from the optimisation
process.
}
\note{
vector \code{w} needs to be provided for the Bass curve in the order of
  \code{"p", "q", "m"}, where "p" is the coefficient of innovation, "q" is the
  coeficient of imitation and "m" is the market size coefficient.
  
  For the Gompertz curve vector \code{w} needs to be in the form of
  \code{("a", "b", "m")}. Where "a" is the x-axis displacement coefficient, "b"
  determines the growth rate and "m" sets, similarly to Bass model, the
  market potential (saturation point).
  
  For the Shifted-Gompertz curve vector \code{w} needs to be in the form of 
  \code{("a", "b", "c", "m")}. Where "a" is the x-axis displacement
  coefficient, "b" determines the growth rate, "c" is the shifting parameter
  and "m" sets, similarly to Bass model, the market potential (saturation
  point).

\section{Bass curve}{

The optimisation of the Bass curve is initialisated by the linear
aproximation suggested in Bass (1969).
}

\section{Gompertz curve}{

The initialisation of the Gompertz curve uses the approach suggested by Jukic
et al. (2004), but is adapted to allow for the non-exponential version of
Gompertz curve. This makes the market potential parameter equivalent to the Bass curves's 
and the market potential from Bass curve is used for initialisation.
}

\section{Gamma/Shifted Gompertz}{

The curve is initialised by assuming the shift operator to be 1 and 
becomes equivalent to the Bass curve, as shown in Bemmaor (1994). A Bass
curve is therefore used as an estimator for the remaining initial parameters.
