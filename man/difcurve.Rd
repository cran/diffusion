\title{Calculates the values for various diffusion curves, given some parameters.}
\usage{
difcurve(n, w = c(0.01, 0.1, 10), type = c("bass", "gompertz",
  "gsgompertz"), curve = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of periods to calculate values for.}

\item{w}{vector of curve parameters (see note). If argument curve is used, this is ignored.}

\item{type}{diffusion curve to use. This can be "bass", "gompertz" and "gsgompertz". If argument curve is used, this is ignored.}

\item{curve}{if provided \code{w} and \code{type} are taken from an object of class \code{diffusion}, the output of \code{\link{diffusion}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of values with each row being a period.
}
\description{
This function calculates the values of diffusion curves that can be of \code{"bass"}, 
\code{"gompertz"} or \code{"gsgompertz"} type, given some parameters.
}
\note{
\code{w} needs to be provided for the Bass curve in the order of
  \code{"p", "q", "m"}, where "p" is the coefficient of innovation, "q" is the
  coefficient of imitation and "m" is the market size coefficient.
  
  For the Gompertz curve, vector \code{w} needs to be in the form of
  \code{("a", "b", "m")}. Where "a" is the x-axis displacement coefficient, "b"
  determines the growth rate and "m" sets, similarly to Bass model, the
  market potential (saturation point).
  
  For the Shifted-Gompertz curve, vector \code{w} needs to be in the form of 
  \code{("a", "b", "c", "m")}. Where "a" is the x-axis displacement
  coefficient, "b" determines the growth rate, "c" is the shifting parameter
  and "m" sets, similarly to Bass model, the market potential (saturation
  point).
